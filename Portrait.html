    <p>Sa unang tingin agad na nahumaling
Sa nagniningning mong mga mata
Ika'y isang bituin na nagmula sa langit

Hindi ko mawari ang taglay mong tinatangi
Sadya namang nakakabighani
'Di maipaliwanag ang nararamdaman

Namumukadkad ang aking ligaya
Sa tuwing ika'y papalapit na
Hawakan mo ang aking kamay

O paraluman
Ika'y akin nang
Dadalhin sa
'Di mo inaasahang paraiso
Palagi kitang
Aawitan ng kundiman
'Di magsasawa
'Di ka pababayaan
Isasayaw kita
Hanggang sa walang hanggan

Mga gunita na laging naiisip
Sumisilip sumisilip
Ang itinakda ng mahiwaga
Liwanag na dulot mo
Nagbigay sinag sa madilim kong mundo
Ibang-iba ako
Kapag ikaw na ang kapiling
Sumisiping ang buwan at mga bituin
Na para bang sumasang-ayon sa atin
Ang kalawakan kalawakan

Namumukadkad ang aking ligaya

Hawakan mo ang aking kamay

Naghahangad sa taong 'di babalik subukan mo namang magpahinga

Pull me close
Kiss me hard
And tell me that you love me

Like how you wanted me before baby
When love was a myth
You came to my life at my lowest

But where did you go
We gave our promises in front of mama
In reality we werent for each other
My love was sincere for you baby
I had a feeling you faked yours maybe

You were my first and last
And you were my only chance
But I saw you with somebody new
Was I not good enough for you
I gave up everything just to be with you
Now I can't replace you

Do you still have the letter that I gave you
Or the flowers that I saved up just for you
Did you throw it away
Did it die like the way that our love did

And baby you know
That all I needed was assurance
Was I still asking for it too much
I was overthink bout it too much
What's your excuse to leave
I was begging you please
And I know you cheated
Are you scared to face the fact that
You couldn't tell me

You were my first and last
And you were my only chance
I saw you with somebody new
Was I not good enough for you
I gave up everything just to be with you
Now I can't replace you
<!-- <I See The Light> -->
All those days watching from the windows
All those years outside looking in
All that time never even knowing
Just how blind I've been
Now I'm here blinking in the starlight
Now I'm here suddenly I see
Standing here it's oh so clear
I'm where I'm meant to be

And at last I see the light
And it's like the fog has lifted
And at last I see the light
And it's like the sky is new
And it's warm and real and bright
And the world has somehow shifted
All at once everything looks different
Now that I see you
All those days chasing down a daydream
All those years living in a blur
All that time never truly seeing
Things the way they were
Now she's here shining in the starlight
Now she's here suddenly I know
If she's here it's crystal clear
I'm where I'm meant to go
And at last I see the light
And it's like the fog is lifted
And at last I see the light
And it's like the sky is new
And it's warm and real and bright
And the world has somehow shifted
All at once everything is different
Now that I see you
Now that I see you
You are the sunshine of my life
That's why I'll always be around,
You are the apple of my eye,
Forever you'll stay in my heart

I feel like this is the beginning,
Though I've loved you for a million years,
And if I thought our love was ending,
I'd find myself drowning in my own tears

You are the sunshine of my life,
That's why I'll always stay around,
You are the apple of my eye,
Forever you'll stay in my heart

You must have known that I was lonely,
Because you came to my rescue,
And I know that this must be heaven,
How could so much love be inside of you?

You are the sunshine of my life, yeah,
That's why I'll always stay around,
You are the apple of my eye,
Forever you'll stay in my heart

Love has joined us,
Love has joined us,
Let's think sweet love
<!-- <Haven't met you yet> -->
I'm not surprised, not everything lasts
I've broken my heart so many times I stopped keeping track
Talk myself in, I talk myself out
I get all worked up then I let myself down

I tried so very hard not to lose it
I came up with a million excuses
I thought, I thought of every possibility

And I know some day that it'll all turn out
You'll make me work so we can work to work it out
And I promise you kid that I'll give so much more than I get
I just haven't met you yet

Hmm... hmm

I might have to wait, I'll never give up
I guess it's half timing and the other half's luck
Wherever you are, whenever it's right
You'll come out of nowhere and into my life

And I know that we can be so amazing
And baby your love is gonna change me
And now I can see every possibility

Somehow I know that it'll all turn out
You'll make me work so we can work to work it out
And promise you kid I'll give so much more than I get
I just haven't met you yet

They say all's fair in love and war
But I won't need to fight it
We'll get it right and we'll be united

And I know that we can be so amazing
And being in your life is gonna change me
And now I can see every single possibility

And someday I know it'll all turn out
And I'll work to work it out
Promise you kid I'll give more than I get, than I get, than I get, than I get

Oh you know it'll all turn out
And you'll make me work so we can work to work it out
And promise you kid to give so much more than I get yeah
I just haven't met you yet

I just haven't met you yet
Oh promise you kid to give so much more than I get

Another summer day
Has come and gone away
In Paris and Rome
But I wanna go home

May be surrounded by
A million people I
Still feel all alone
Just wanna go home
Oh, I miss you, you know

And I've been keeping all the letters that I wrote to you
Each one a line or two
"I'm fine baby, how are you?"
Well, I would send them but I know that it's just not enough
My words were cold and flat
And you deserve more than that

Another aeroplane
Another sunny place
I'm lucky, I know
But I wanna go home
I've got to go home

Let me go home
I'm just too far from where you are
I wanna come home

And I feel just like I'm living someone else's life
It's like I just stepped outside
When everything was going right
And I know just why you could not
Come along with me
This was not your dream
But you always believed in me

Another winter day has come
And gone away
In either Paris or Rome
And I wanna go home
Let me go home

And I'm surrounded by
A million people I
Still feel alone
And let me go home
Oh, I miss you, you know

Baby, I'm done
I gotta go home
Let me go home

Ah, when you smile at me you know exactly what you do.
Baby, don't pretend that you don't know it's true.
'Cause you can see it when I look at you.

And in this crazy life, and through these crazy times
It's you, it's you, you make me sing.
You're every line, you're every word, you're everything.

You're a carousel, you're a wishing well,
And you light me up, when you ring my bell.
You're a mystery, you're from outer space,
You're every minute of my every day.

And I can't believe, uh, that I'm your man,
And I get to kiss you, baby, just because I can.
Whatever comes our way, ah, we'll see it through,
And you know that's what our love can do.

And in this crazy life, and through these crazy times
It's you, it's you, you make me sing.

When you couldn't get by
By yourself
And I don't know who would ever want to tear the seam
Of someone's dream

Baby, it's fine,
You said that we should just be friends
Well, I came up with that line
And I'm sure that it's for the best
If you ever change your mind,
Don't hold your breath

When you said goodbye,
My whole world shined

And I know there's no denying

It's a beautiful day, the sun is up, the music's playing
And even if it started raining
You won't hear this boy complaining
'Cause I'm glad that you're the one who got away
It's a beautiful day

It's my turn to fly,
So, girls, get in line
'Cause I'm easy, no playing this guy like a fool
Now I'm alright
Might've had me caged before, but not tonight

And you may not believe,
That, baby, I'm relieved
This fire inside: it burns too bright
I don't wanna say "so long",
I just wanna to say "goodbye"

And even if it started raining
You won't hear this boy complaining
'Cause I'm glad that you're the one who got away,

'Cause if you ever think I'll take up
My time with thinking of our break-up
Then you've got another thing coming your way

Oh, baby, any day
That you're gone away
It's a beautiful day

It's the reason why I never called you back
Hope you're not offended. You are my malady
You say it's easy come. I'm saying it's easy go
They're lining up for you. So, what you need me for?

Or the snow cap of a mountain top?
Or the northern lights set in motion?
Or a heartbeat slowed to a stop?

Have you read a book by candle light?
Or heard a leader's call to arms?
Have you ever felt my love burn so bright?
Like a fireball in your palms

You will always be part of my tapestry
More than all the places I've been

To see what's mine and yours

More than all the places I've been
You will always be part of my tapestry

The taste of a cigarette in Paris in Spring
Conversation with elders and the wisdom they bring
Sunrise in Georgia as holy choirs sing
The view from an aeroplane at twelve thousand feet

Meet God on a mountain top alone with the stars
Find love somewhere, anywhere, fall deep from the start
Misplace my mind and follow my heart
See the cosmos unfolding and know I'm a part

I'll sleep when I'm older
When the world's got me weathered I'll finally find my way home
I'll sleep when I'm older
Sleep when I'm older

I'll be a firework, not a flickering flame
Treat life all around me like a one player game
I'll go to the party and forget all their names
Should it come back to haunt me, it ends all the same

I'll sleep when I'm older
When the world's got me weathered I'll finally find my way home
I'll sleep when I'm older

Sleep when I'm older

Just because it won't come easily
Doesn't mean we shouldn't try

We had a good thing going lately
Might not have always been a fairy tale
But you know and I know
That they ain't real
I'll take the truth over the story

You might have tried my patience lately
But I'm not about to let us fail
I'll be the wind picking up your sail
But won't you do something for me?

Don't you tell me that it wasn't meant to be
Call it quits
Call it destiny
Just because it won't come easily
Doesn't mean we shouldn't try

Coming and going
Inside out
Back to front
Oh, tangled and messy
That's how we've been and we'll always be
And that's alright with me

Don't you tell me that it wasn't meant to be
Call it quits
Call it destiny
Just because it won't come easily
Doesn't mean we shouldn't try, try, try
Just because it won't come easily
Doesn't mean we shouldn't try

Just because it won't come easily
Doesn't mean we shouldn't try, try, try
Just because it won't come easily
Doesn't mean we shouldn't try

I know it's not very cool
Standing here, serenading like a fool
I don't care
I'll gladly be a fool for you

I know the idea isn't new
To fall in love with someone on first view
But I don't care
I think I'll fall in love with you

I'll put on my Sunday best
You pick out your favourite dress
I'll take you somewhere new
I'll be old-fashioned for you

It's a cliché or so I'm told
To give your jacket up to someone when it's cold
But I don't care
I don't mind the midnight air
Oh, oh

I'll walk you home, to your front door
I'll say farewell until the morning calls
I'll be smiling a bigger smile than before

I'll put on my Sunday best
You pick out your favourite dress
And I'll take you somewhere new

<!-- <Regent's Park> -->
I must have sent four hundred poems on the way you used to smile at me
I used to write them for you daily but my thumbs are running dry lately
No one wants to hear a song about the bitch that broke my heart
I should've listened to my mama, she saw through you from the start

But now we're here in Regent's Park amongst the flowers
And I wish it would rain
'Cause in the sun, you look so lovely that I'm falling for you over again
Since I have nothing left to say that will make you change your mind
I'll say goodbye on a beautiful spring day

There was a place not too dissimilar to this one where I first saw your face
You look like home, sat all alone
I shoulda found somebody cheaper to chase
Tragically, nobody told me how expensive you could be
I lost more than money, dear, you knocked the swagger out of me

But now we're here in Regent's Park amongst the flowers
And I wish it would rain
'Cause in the sun, you look so lovely that I'm falling for you over again
Since I have nothing left to say that will make you change your mind
Make you change your mind
I'll say goodbye on a beautiful spring day
<!-- <The Most Beautiful Thing> -->
Will it be a pavement or a sidewalk
When I finally lay my eyes on you
Someone I've already loved
Or will you find your way out of the blue?

Will it be my flat or your apartment
When I finally realise I do?
Will we meet on Baker Street
Or find ourselves on Melrose Avenue?

I don't know who you are
But I'll save you a seat
Hang my coat on a chair next to me
I tried to reassure the waiter
Say you're down the street
He laughed at me
So here's to you
The most beautiful thing that I have never seen

Someone on a screen asked me a question
Something about what love means to me
Maybe it's just circumstance
Or general compatibility

I don't know who you are
But I'll save you a seat
Hang my coat on a chair next to me
I tried to reassure the waiter
Say you're down the street
He laughed at me

The most beautiful thing that I have never seen
<!-- <Nothing> -->
Tracksuits and red wine, movies for two
We'll take off our phones and we'll turn off our shoes
We'll play Nintendo though I always lose
Cos you watch the TV while I'm watching you
There's not many people I'd honestly say I don't mind losing to
But there's nothing like doing nothing with you

Dumb conversation, we lose track of time
Have I told you lately I'm grateful you're mine
We watch "The Notebook" for the 17th time
I'll say it's stupid, then you catch me crying
We're not making out on a boat in the rain or in a house I painted blue
But there's nothing like doing nothing with you

So shut all the windows and lock all the doors
We're not looking for no one, don't need nothing more
You'll bite my lip and I'll want you more
Until we end up in a heap on the floor

Mmmmmmm...

You could be dancing on table tops wearing high heels
Drinking until the world spins like a wheel
But tonight your apartment has so much appeal
Who needs stars, we've got a roof
And there's nothing like doing nothing with you
No, there's nothing like doing nothing with you

I'm lost in empty pillow talk again
I'm lost in empty pillow talk again

This bed's an island made of feather down, and I'm stuck here alone
With little else but memories of you, on memory foam

Visions of a brighter love, I'd kill for one more day
To pool my thoughts, and find the words to say

If these sheets were the states, and you were miles away,
I'd fold them end over end to bring you closer to me.
Because I don't sleep at all without you pressed up against me.
I settle for long distance calls, I'm lost in empty pillow talk again.

I'm lost in empty pillow talk again

This room's become a mausoleum, filled with relics of regret
Paying dues to every moment wasted, on words left unsaid
Collisions of a finer love, I'd kill for one more way
To tell you how you make me better every day

If these sheets were the states, and you were miles away,
I'd fold them end over end to bring you closer to me.
Because I don't sleep at all without you pressed up against me.

I look at her and have to smile
As we go driving for a while
Her hair blowing in the open window of my car
And as we go the traffic lights
Watch them glimmer in her eyes
In the darkness of the evening

And I've got all that I need
Right here in the passenger seat
Oh, and I can't keep my eyes on the road
Knowing that she's inches from me

We stop to get something to drink
My mind clouds and I can't think
Scared to death to say i love her
Then a moon peeks from the clouds
Hear my heart that beats so loud
Try to tell her simply

That I've got all that I need
Right here in the passenger seat
Oh, and I can't keep my eyes on the road
Knowing that she's inches from me

Oh, and I've got all that I need
Right here in the passenger seat
Oh, and I can't keep my eyes on the road
Knowing that she's inches from me

Oh, and I know this love grow

Make it a sweet, sweet goodbye
It could be for the last time and it's not right.
"Don't let yourself get in over your head, " he said.
Alone and far from home I'll find you...

Dead, like a candle you burned out;
Spill the wax over the spaces left in place of angry words.
Scream, to be heard, like you needed any more attention;
Throw the bottle, break the door, and disappear.

Sing me to sleep, I'll see you in my dreams,
Waiting to say, "I miss you. I'm so sorry."

Forever's never seemed so long as when you're not around
It's like a piece of me is missing.
I could have learned so much from you but what's left now?
Don't you realize you shot this family a world of pain?
Can't you see there could have been a happy ending we let go?

Sing me to sleep, I'll see you in my dreams,
Waiting to say, "I miss you. I'm so sorry."

Sing me to sleep.
Sing me to sleep.
Sing me to sleep.
Sing me to s...

Sing me to sleep (You've taken so much with you...)

Waiting to say, "I miss you. I'm so sorry."

I am a critic
Of my own critical need to define myself
With wine, and words, and lovers
And friends who don't understand

So there, I just said it
You know that admitting the problem is the first step
Towards repair, "We all recover"
Say the friends turned to wine-drunk lovers

Smile, tell me I'm alright
With a goodbye
You are so misleading
A kiss or a gun fight
High-noon or midnight
Darling, I don't want to know
If I'm just a short sight on a cold night
The canals are freezing
So tell me I'm alright with a goodbye

Am I a villain?
Cast among heroes with all of their
Underwhelming overbearing struggles
To become what they'll never be?

Friends to the wicked
Caution is calling, but nobody's home
The lights are off, the party's over
Now you're stuck plucking three-leaf clovers

Smile, tell me I'm alright
With a goodbye
You are so misleading

Like your life is a map with no compass to guide,
At the bar drinkin’ way too much

Of great times with far better people
And weekends with our friends

How you don’t wanna make the same mistakes as them
I’ll say it’s all about stickin’ it out
And trying to feel forever young

My ship went down
In a sea of sound.
When I woke up alone I had everything:
A handful of moments I wished I could change
And a tongue like a nightmare that cut like a blade.

In a city of fools,
I was careful and cool,
But they tore me apart like a hurricane...

But I was carried away.

But I'm smiling at everything.
Therapy...
You were never a friend to me
And you can keep all your misery.

My lungs gave out
As I faced the crowd.
I think that keeping this up could be dangerous.
I'm flesh and bone,
I'm a rolling stone
And the experts say I'm delirious.

Give me therapy.
I'm a walking travesty
But I'm smiling at everything.

From the get-go I knew this was hard to hold
Like a crash the whole thing spun out of control
Oh, on a wire, we were dancing
Two kids, no consequences
Pull the trigger, without thinking

Well there's no way out of this

Every storm that comes,
Also comes to an end.
Oh, resistance is useless
